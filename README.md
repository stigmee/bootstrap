# Chreage setup and code source compilation

Chreage's development is depending on the following projects as third parts:
- Brave-core: https://github.com/brave/brave-browser
- Godot: https://github.com/godotengine/godot

This document will explain how to setup, download third-parts and compile
Chreage project on Linux using the script `bootstrap.sh`. Depending on the
environment of your operating system, you may have more or less difficulties to
compile third parts if you are trying to compile them
[directly](https://github.com/chreage-rebirth/doc)) that is why we are also
offering a Dockerfile to allow you to have a correct compilation environment
(this is still experimental since exporting the display an Vulkan for Docker can
be difficult). You will just need two install two packages (`apt-get install`
for example):
- Docker (or Podman which is a Docker without daemon and you can `alias
  docker=podman` for following this document).
- Git to download the code source and apply patches.

## Steps

- Export and ideally save this line inside your `~/.bashrc` file (or any
equivalent file). Do not forget to replace `path/for/chreage_workspace` by the
desired folder holding the whole project (let say around 100 gigabytes):
```bash
export WORKSPACE_CHREAGE=path/for/chreage_workspace
```

- git clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chreage-rebirth/bootstrap.git --depth=1
cd bootstrap
```

- You can edit some settings inside the script:
  - The versions for Godot (currently `GODOT_VERSION=3.4-stable`) and Brave (currently `BRAVE_VERSION=v1.32.96`).
  - If you want compiling using Docker (`USING_DOCKER=1`) or not (`USING_DOCKER=`).

- Execute the bash script:
```bash
./bootstrap.sh $WORKSPACE_CHREAGE
```

- After long hours of compilation.
  - If Docker was not used:
    - you can run Godot: `$WORKSPACE_CHREAGE/godot/bin/godot.linuxbsd.tools.64`
    - you can run Brave: `cd $WORKSPACE_CHREAGE; npm start Component`
  - If Docker was used:
```bash
TODO
#Xephyr -resizeable :1 &
#
#docker run --rm -ti  --shm-size 1GB  -e DISPLAY=:1 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /#workspace/brave-browser chreage:latest /bin/bash -c "/workspace/brave-browser/src/out/Component/brave --enable-#logging --v=0 --disable-brave-update --no-sandbox"
#
# $WORKSPACE_CHREAGE/godot/bin/godot.linuxbsd.tools.64
```

- With Docker, if you want to modify the Chreage's code source and recompile it:
```bash
cd $WORKSPACE_CHREAGE
docker run --rm -ti -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace chreage:latest /bin/bash
```
