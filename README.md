# Stigmee setup and code source compilation

Stigmee's development is depending on the following projects as third parts:

- Godot: https://github.com/godotengine/godot for the 3d rendering
- Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)
  https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/src/master/
- (Brave-core: https://github.com/brave/brave-browser replaced by CEF).

This document will explain how to setup, download third-parts and compile
Stigmee project on Linux (for the moment) using the **entry-point** script
[bootstrap.sh](bootstrap.sh). Depending on the environment of your operating
system, you may have more or less difficulties to compile third parts if you are
trying to compile them [directly](https://github.com/stigmee/doc#installation))
that is why we are also offering a [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) (called optionaly by
bootstrap.sh) to offer you a correct compilation environment (**Note:** the
usage of docker is still experimental since exporting the display an Vulkan for
Docker can be difficult).

**Be sure you have around 60 gigabytes of free space on your hard disk.**

You will just need two install two packages (`apt-get install`
for example):
- Docker (or Podman which is a Docker without daemon and you can `alias
  docker=podman` for following this document).
- Git to download the code source and apply patches.

## Bootstraping Stigmee

- Create an environement variable `$WORKSPACE_STIGMEE` refering to the root folder for compiling Stigmee.
Save this variable in your `~/.bashrc` file (or any equivalent file):
```bash
export WORKSPACE_STIGMEE=/your/desired/path/for/stigmee_workspace
```

- Create the workspace folder:
```bash
mkdir -p $WORKSPACE_STIGMEE
cd $WORKSPACE_STIGMEE
```

- git clone the bootstraper git repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/stigmee-rebirth/bootstrap.git --depth=1
cd bootstrap
```

- Install the needed packages for your operating system. We are offering you a meta-package for this.
A meta package is package holding the list of packages to install. In this way, the package manager will
make the graph of dependencies which will automatically uninstall unused packages the day you desired to
uninstall Stigmee (See [meta/README.md](meta/README.md) for more informations).
**Note:** this is still experimental and only working for Debian 11 (work in progress).
```bash
apt-get install ./meta/stigmee-developpers_1.0_all.deb
# Alternative:
# sudo dpkg -i ./meta/stigmee-developpers_1.0_all.deb
```

- Optionally, you can edit some settings inside the script [settings.sh](settings.sh) :
  - The versions for Godot (currently `GODOT_VERSION=3.4-stable`), CEF (currently
    `CHROMIUM_EMBEDDED_FRAMEWORK_VERSION=4664`), Brave (is not currently compile but if
    needed, in the future, set `BRAVE_VERSION=v1.32.96`). **Note:** Unseting the version
    will make the force ignore the third-part to be installed (like currently for Brave).
  - If you want to compile Stigmee using Docker (`USING_DOCKER=1`) or not (`USING_DOCKER=`)
    **Note:** Docker is still experimental.

- Execute the bash script. It will git clone and start the compilation:
```bash
./bootstrap.sh $WORKSPACE_STIGMEE
```

- After long hours of compilation (if you see this king of message `[1:16:30] Still working on: src` during hours, this step is normal).
  - If Docker was not used:
    - you can run Godot: `$WORKSPACE_STIGMEE/godot/bin/godot.linuxbsd.tools.64`
    - you can run Brave (if installed): `cd $WORKSPACE_STIGMEE; npm start Component`
  - If Docker was used:
```bash
TODO
#Xephyr -resizeable :1 &
#
#docker run --rm -ti  --shm-size 1GB  -e DISPLAY=:1 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /#workspace/brave-browser stigmee:latest /bin/bash -c "/workspace/brave-browser/src/out/Component/brave --enable-#logging --v=0 --disable-brave-update --no-sandbox"
#
# $WORKSPACE_STIGMEE/godot/bin/godot.linuxbsd.tools.64
```

- With Docker, if you want to modify the Stigmee's code source and recompile it:
```bash
cd $WORKSPACE_STIGMEE
docker run --rm -ti -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace stigmee:latest /bin/bash
```
